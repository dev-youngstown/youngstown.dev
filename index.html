        <h2>Our process</h2>

        <p>
          Each startup we work with is assigned a Project Manager - a senior
          software engineer who has years of experience building real-world
          software projects for companies of all sizes.
        </p>

          Each startup we work with is assigned a Project Manager - a senior
          software engineer who has years of experience building real-world
          software projects for companies of all sizes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our Project Managers help you create a well defined scope of work,
          perfect for a student to pick up. Our project managers are experts at
          cutting scope and work with a focus on getting your project into users
          hands as fast as possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          We then use our connections with local organizations such as Code
          Youngstown, YSU, and MCCTC to select students are ready to take their
          experience to the next level, and are excited at the prospect of
          working on a project like yours.
        </p>

        <p>
          Students execute the work transparently - expect weekly progress
          check-ins with your and to have access to all outputs from day 1.

            Give talented local student software developers the 1 year of
            experience they need to be qualified to work remotely from
            Youngstown, OH
          </li>
          <li>
            Continue to grow our community of local developers, Code Youngstown
          </li>
          <li>
            Encourage our community of local software developers to start their
            own startups

        <h2>What we don't do</h2>

        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            <h3>Brownfields</h3>
            <p>
              We believe that brownfield projects require a Project Manager who
              is experienced with the existing project to effectively guide and
              get the most out of a student. Instead, we suggest hiring an
              intern directly, which are happy to help you find!
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Give companies direct access to students</h3>
            <p>
              The Project Manager plays the important role of keeping the
              project within a scope executable by the student, which is an
              important part of making sure the project output is something that
              you can deliver to your users.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Not pay our students</h3>
            <p>
              All of our students are paid fairly by the hour. Every two weeks
              our students bill us, then Dev Youngstown bills you accordingly.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Make any money</h3>
            <p>
              For now, all of our Project Managers our volunteers. Please be
              kind to them and be conscientious of their time.
